          Because you served honorably in one period of service, you can apply for VA benefits using that honorable characterization. You earned your benefits during the period in which you served honorably. The only exception is for service-connected disability compensation.

          Because you served honorably in one period of service, you can apply for VA benefits using that honorable characterization. You earned your benefits during the period in which you served honorably. This is true even if you didnâ€™t receive an actual discharge at the end of the honorable period. If you completed your original contract period without any disciplinary problems, you can use this period of service to establish your eligibility, even if you re-enlisted or extended your service and did not receive an "Honorable" DD-214. If you believe there is a period of service that entitles you to benefits, but which is not reflected on a DD-214, you will likely need to ask the VA to do a Character of Service Determination. The only exception is for service-connected disability compensation. If your disability began during your less than honorable period of service, you won't be eligible to earn disability compensation unless you get your discharge upgraded.
