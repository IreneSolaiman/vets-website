#### Fully developed claims
You can use the Fully Developed Claims (FDC) program to get a faster decision on your disability benefits claim.

With this program, you send in all the evidence (supporting documents) you have—or can easily get—when you file your claim. This may include:
- Records of medical treatment you've received for the claimed illness or injury (also known as a condition) while serving in the military
-	Military personnel records that relate to the claimed condition
-	Private medical records related to the claimed condition, like reports from your own doctor or X-rays or other test results from a non-VA hospital or other treatment center

We consider your disability benefits claims to be fully developed when:
- You've sent us all related evidence, **and**
- We plan to get your federal records, if needed, **and**
- We plan to arrange for any added health exams or doctors' opinions that we may need

If we discover that there are other private records we need to decide your claim, we’ll remove your claim from the FDC program and review it through the standard claims process.
